# SaveTheWorld
A site about an imaginary nonprofit organization made from scratch exclusively on Notepad++ without any pre-made templates, tested only on Google Chrome. 
The site's content is written in Greek, my native language. Contact info is changed so I keep my privacy... private.

It's not hosted online, it's just a source code.
Also, it's not good looking since I wasn't assisted by a graphic designer or used any template. The deal here was to test and enhance my HTML/CSS knowledge/abilities.

(minor bug: sider buttons work only if you press them on the letters. the rest of the button won't redirect you.)

suggestions are welcomed and appreciated :)


In case you don't know what to do: Click on the green "Clone or Download" button, click "Download Zip". Unzip it, rename "pictures file" to "pictures" and open "index.html", in the "html file".
