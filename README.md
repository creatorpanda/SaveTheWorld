# SaveTheWorld
A site about an imaginary non profit organization made from scratch exclusively on Notepad++ without any pre made templates, tested only on Google Chrome. 
The site's content is written in Greek, my native language. Contact info is changed so i keep my privacy... private.

It's not hosted online, it's just a source code.
Also, it hasn't the greatest appearance since I wasn't assisted by a graphic designer. The deal here was to test and enhance my HTML/CSS knowledge/abilities.

(minor bug: sider buttons work only if you press them on the letters. the rest of the button won't redirect you.)

suggestions are welcomed and appreciated :)
